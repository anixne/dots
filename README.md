# 🛠️ Dotfiles & Configs

A curated collection of my personal configuration files (dotfiles)
## 📁 Structure

This repository includes configuration files for:

- **neofetch** - a command-line system information tool written in bash 
- **Alacritty** - Terminal emulator settings with custom themes and transparency
- **Helix** - Rust based modal text editor, which is light-weight, highly configurable, packed with several built-in features.

> You can use this as a reference, or clone and adapt to your own setup.

## 🚀 Usage

To use these configs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anixne/dots.git
